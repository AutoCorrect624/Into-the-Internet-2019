<h3 class="headingD">Relying on the Internet Can be Dangerous</h3>

<p>The Internet is one of humanity's greatest creations, but it does come with its own dangers. Since everyone is connected online people have found ways to exploit these connections for their own gain. People can use programming to hack websites or to create programs to send out spam messages and get information from you. Other people have thought of more creative ways to access information by using a tactic known as social engineering. Social engineering allows someone to manipulate others with simple actions like sending scam email, pretending to be someone else, calling a user and tricking them to think they are from a company, or using blackmail.  There are also simple cases of people taking advantage of the anonymous nature of the Internet to bully and harass others.</p>

If the Internet would ever fail or shutdown could permanently damage our society. Different companies have been putting a large amount of their data onto networks and servers, but relying that heavily on the Internet or on technologies can be very tragic for a business.</p>

<p>It is important to practice proper Internet safety. To protect yourself online you must follow some common tips. The biggest mistake you should avoid online is using your full name on social media or unsafe websites. Never provide personal details to anyone online and always protect you password. Don't ever post anything on social media if you wouldn't want parents or employers. It's common for employers to check social media to get a more in depth look into their employees personal lives. Most importantly always keep in mind that once you post or upload something, it can never be taken back down.</p>
