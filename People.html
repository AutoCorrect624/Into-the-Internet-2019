<h1 class="titleP">The Creators of the Internet</h1>

<p class="introP">There was an idea that turned into one of the largest operations in the world - the Internet. This concept made the world sky rocket to an amazing place, where the options are limitless. Let's take a look at everything that goes on within the world of networks.</p>

		<td>Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider was born March 11th, 1915 in St. Louis, Missouri. Licklider was a computer scientist and psychologist. He had a huge impact on the entire history of the computing world. His parents were Joseph Parron Licklider and Margaret Robnett Licklider. His father being a baptist minister never really affected his life. He ended up studying at Washington University in St. Louis. He gained a bachelor's degree in physics, mathematics, and psychology, and a masters in psychology. He also went to the University of Rochester in 1942 for a PhD in psychoacoustics. Licklider worked at Harvard for about seven years. He started to like information technology and then went to MIT after Harvard to teach. He worked on various projects at MIT. Licklider was a major contributor to the technology that we use today.

		<td>Vinton Cerf was born on June 23rd, 1943 in New Haven, Connecticut. He is known as one of “the fathers of the Internet”. Cerf was a co-inventor of TCP/IP, which is what he is known most for.  Cerf is the son of Muriel and Vinton Thurston Cerf. While in his high school, Vinton Cerf worked on the Apollo program, which was a way that he could help write statistical analysis software for F-1 engines. From an early start, he was getting involved in technology, in help from his father being an aerospace executive.

		<td>Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8th, 1955 in London, England. His parents were Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. Tim Berners-Lee had a huge contribution to the world of technology. Making an impact on technology ran through the family because his parents also had their share of achievements.. They had worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, which was the first commercially built computer.
